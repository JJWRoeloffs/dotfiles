### dotfiles

Originally based off [Elenapan's dotfiles](https://github.com/elenapan/dotfiles).

Contents:

- AwesomeWM config: taken nearly verbatim from Elenapan. Mine might look quite different, but the code is nearly identical.
- Nvim config: Lives in a [separate repository](https://github.com/JJWRoeloffs/nvim-config).
- Zsh config: A fairly minimal zsh config with the pure promt and a few zinit plugins.
- Alacritty config: Fancy colours, thrown together from a few different colour schemes.
- Rofi config: Custom config to match my Alacritty colour scheme and it's rounded corners.
- .vimrc: Sometimes, you don't need nvim

##### Install script (USE WITH CAUTION!):

There is an install script at `install.sh` that worked perfectly for me on Debian 12 when I wrote it. However, I am not keeping it updated or considered edge cases that were not relevant for me, so your milage may vary. It's just there such that I could install it on a few different machines.

Currently, I am in the process of setting everything up, so It's not going to be clean, or even all there. In the meantime, please enjoy this image of a cat:
